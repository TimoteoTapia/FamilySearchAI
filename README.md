# Overview

As a software development, I was focused on building chatbot solutions that enhance user experience and provide accurate information. This project aims to leverage AI and machine learning technologies to develop a specialized chatbot that assists users in navigating FamilySearch and genealogy-related inquiries.

The data set I am analyzing consists of markdown documents sourced from various genealogy resources, containing valuable information on FamilySearch topics. This data can be found at [FamilySearch Documentation](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/source-linker-learning-center).

The purpose of writing this software is to create an intelligent chatbot that can understand user queries, retrieve relevant information from the indexed content, and present it in a clear and structured manner. This analysis aims to improve the chatbot's ability to provide contextually rich responses and assist users effectively.

# Data Analysis Results

Through this analysis, I have identified key questions and answers related to FamilySearch. Some examples include:

- **Question 1:** What are record hints in Family Tree?

  - **Answer:** Record hints are suggestions provided by FamilySearch to help users find additional information about their ancestors.

- **Question 2:** How can I attach sources to my family tree?

  - **Answer:** Users can attach sources by navigating to the profile of an ancestor and selecting the option to add sources from available records.

- **Question 3:** What tools does FamilySearch offer for genealogical research?
  - **Answer:** FamilySearch provides various tools, including search features, record hints, and collaborative family tree building.

# Development Environment

I developed this software using Python 3.12, leveraging several libraries and frameworks, including:

- Gradio for creating the chatbot interface.
- Pinecone for vector storage and retrieval of documents.
- LlamaIndex for managing the query engine and document ingestion.
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

# Future Work

There are several areas for improvement and features to add in the future:

- Improve the chatbot's contextual understanding to provide more nuanced answers.
- Enhance the user interface for a better user experience.
- Expand the dataset with more diverse genealogy resources and FAQs.
- Implement user feedback mechanisms to refine the chatbot's responses.
