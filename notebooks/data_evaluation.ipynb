You can easily transfer information from these record hints to Family Tree without needing to retype it.\\n\\nTo make the most of record hints, you should:\\n\\n1. Verify that the record hint is indeed about your ancestor.\\n2. Transfer any desired information from the record hint to Family Tree. Note that you cannot replace existing information directly on the website; you'll need to update it manually in Family Tree. However, you can replace information using the mobile app.\\n3.

You can easily transfer information from these record hints to Family Tree without needing to retype it.\\n\\nTo make the most of record hints, you should:\\n\\n1. Verify that the record hint is indeed about your ancestor.\\n2. Transfer any desired information from the record hint to Family Tree. Note that you cannot replace existing information directly on the website; you'll need to update it manually in Family Tree. However, you can replace information using the mobile app.\\n3.

When you click on it, you can see the details associated with that ancestor, which helps you understand their profile better.\\n\\n- The **Compare** button, represented by a purple icon, is used to compare the information from the historical record (left column) with the details already in the Family Tree (right column). When you click this button, it expands both columns so you can see the details side by side. This is particularly useful for determining if the person in the record is the same as the one in Family Tree and for identifying any new or different information that can be added or edited.\\n\\nIn summary, the **Details** button helps you access the ancestor's profile, while the **Compare** button allows you to analyze and link historical records to the Family Tree.\\n\\n**Source**:\\n- **Title**: Understanding the Source Linker screen layout\\n- **Publish Date**: June 06, 2024\\n- **URL**: https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/understanding-the-source-linker-screen-layout  \n",
