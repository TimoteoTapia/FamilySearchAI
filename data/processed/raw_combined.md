# Using Source Linker to attach a record to multiple ancestors



Historical records often include the names of other family members. You can use Source Linker to attach the source to any family member already included in Family Tree. If the person is not yet in Family Tree, you can add the person, and then attach the source after that.

Here is how it works:

1. Review the left column of Source Linker, and look for the names of other family members.
2. When you find the name of another family member, see if there is a corresponding name in the right column. (Hint: if the corresponding names are on different lines, you can drag and drop them with your mouse so that they line up together.)
3. Click the purple **Compare button**.
4. Review the information, and determine if the 2 sides of Source Linker are describing the same person.
5. If the answer is yes, leave a reason statement that explains how you came to your conclusion, and click **Attach**.

**Note:** If something in the source is new or missing from Family Tree, you will have to first click **Add** to add the detail to the right column and then click **Attach**.

# Adding people to the Family Tree through Source Linker

This option appears in Source Linker if a person from a record (left column) isn't identified in Family Tree (right column). This could happen for several reasons:

 1. The person is in Family Tree but is connected to other relatives, not the ones on the record.
2. The person is connected to the family but is not lined up correctly in Source Linker. (See [Using drag and drop in Source Linker to organize families](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/using-drag-and-drop-to-organize-families).)
3. The person is not in Family Tree.

Before adding someone to Family Tree using Source Linker, check to make sure they are not already in Family Tree. If you determine they need to be added:

1. Drag the person's name to the correct line in the left column.
2. Click the blue **Add** button.
3. A panel will appear on the right side of the page with information about the new person filled in. Review it, and addany necessary changes or additions.
4. Click **Create New Person**. The person is added to Family Tree.

# Using Source Linker to detach sources

Source Linker has blue detach buttons and yellow detach buttons. Each one removes the connection between a source and a person in Family Tree but for a different purpose.

### Blue detach button

A blue detach button signifies that the source information in the left column is already attached to the person in the right column.

* In this situation, clicking the blue detach button removes the connection between the information in the two columns.
* You would only want to click the blue detach button if you are certain that the source (left column) and Family Tree (right column) are referring to two separate people.

### Yellow detach button

A yellow Detach button means that the source (left column) is attached to a different person than the one you see in the right column of Source Linker.

* In this situation, clicking the yellow Detach button removes the connection between the source and the *other* profile in Family Tree.
* You would only want to click the yellow Detach button if you are certain that the people you see in the two columns of Source Linker are the same and that the previous attachment was a mistake.

Once you detach the source from the other profile, you can attach it to the person in the right column of Source Linker.

# Determining in Source Linker if a source matches your ancestor

Identifying a match is not always easy. Here is some guidance from experts to help you determine if a record matches an ancestor or not:

 * Ask yourself, “How well does the source match the vital dates, places, and relationships already contained in Family Tree?”
* Ask yourself, “Is there *enough* information to conclude that the record and Family Tree are describing the same person?” Some christening records, for example, list a mother’s or father’s name but no other vital information, such as age or date of birth. While a name is important, it is never a good idea to conclude that a source is about a certain person in Family Tree based on the name alone.
* Ask yourself, “Are there any major red flags?” For example, consider a situation in which most of the details on the record seem to match Family Tree—except for the birth year, which is off by 15 years. In that case, the record might actually be for a cousin.
* Ask yourself, “How trustworthy is the record?” In general, a historical record closest to the event is the most trustworthy. For example, a birth record is more trustworthy for birth information than a death record that might also include birth information.

Finally, keep in mind that errors can be more common in certain types of records than in others. For example, a census taker might have written down names without asking how to spell them correctly. Or a person’s age might have been an approximation.
On a birth certificate, by contrast, you can expect such details to be more reliable.

# Editing your family tree from Source Linker

The details in the right column of Source Linker come from Family Tree. If you see a purple Compare button next to a person’s name, you can edit some of these details. Here is how it works:

 1. Click the purple **Compare button** next to the person’s name whose Family Tree details you would like to edit.
2. With the details expanded, look for the purple label that says **Different**. This label appears when a detail from the source (left column) is different than a detail currently contained in Family Tree.

Please note that even though it says Different, that does not necessarily mean a change needs to be made.
3. Click the **pencil icon** next to the purple label.
4. A pop\-up box with information from Family Tree will appear. Find the detail you want to edit, and make your update.
5. Click **Save**.

If the detail you want to edit is not accompanied by the pencil icon, you will need to go to the ancestor’s person page to make the update.

1. In the right column of Source Linker, click the name of the person whose Family Tree information you would like to edit.
2. Look in the person panel that appears on the right side of the screen, and click **View Person**.
3. Scroll through the **Details tab** until you see the detail you want to edit, and click the **pencil icon**.

# Entering a reason statement in Source Linker

You have the opportunity to enter a reason statement any time you delete, edit, or add to the information already contained in the FamilySearch Family Tree.

* A clearly worded reason statement helps other users understand why you modified the Tree, and they, in turn, will be less likely to undo or change your work.
* Your reason statement does not need to be long or complicated.
* Short is fine—as long as the statement is clear and specific.

# In the source linker, how do I change the focus person to attach sources to other people in Family Tree?

In the source linker, the people are listed according to their relationship to a focus person. The focus person is listed with his or her spouse. You see a section with parents and another with children and siblings.

Some historical records identify in\-laws, grandparents, grandchildren, and other family members who are not displayed on the right side of the screen. To deal with these family members, you change the focus person.

For example, a marriage record lists the bride and groom and each of their parents. When you first display the source linker, the bride is the focus person. When you are ready to work on the husband’s information, make him the focus person.

## Steps (website)

1. While using the source linker on the FamilySearch.org website, click the **Change** link on the left side of the screen.
2. Click the person that you want.
3. In the center of the source linker, click **Change**.
4. Click the person that you want, or enter the ID.

## Steps (mobile app)

The source linker in the mobile app does not allow you to change the focus person.
**Caution:** Sometimes a record hint lines up with the wrong person. For example, a census could show a child who has the same name as a deceased sibling. Since you cannot change the focus person, tap **Not a match** for that person.

# How do I correct parent\-child relationships in Family Tree?

Video: //www.youtube.com/embed/b7K8yBJCMq0?enablejsapi\=1\&playsinline\=1
Correcting parent\-child relationships usually requires some analysis before you begin. Two kinds of problems can exist: duplicate records or incorrect relationship links.

If you make a mistake during this process, do not worry. You can [undo any changes you made](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/how-do-i-undo-an-incorrect-change-in-family-tree) by going through the Latest Changes feature.

When you remove a child's record from a family's records, the child's record stays in Family Tree. If the child is linked to spouses and children, he or she remains linked to them. Similarly, when you remove parents from a relationship to a child, the Family Tree record for each parent remains in Family Tree.

## Before you start

Take some time to figure out what is wrong:

* If the child does not belong in the family, remove or replace the child's link to the parents.
* If the children are right but one or both parents are wrong, you must remove or replace the incorrect parent. Remove or replace [the spouse](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/a-person-in-family-tree-has-the-wrong-spouse) of the correct parent.
* If you see the parents and children multiple times, or in multiple families, look at the ID numbers of the duplicates.

	+ If the ID numbers are different, [merge the duplicate records](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/how-do-i-merge-possible-duplicates-in-family-tree).
	+ If the ID numbers are identical, the child is linked to one of the parents more than once. Use the instructions in this article to remove the extra relationship.

**Tip:** Write down the names and ID numbers of the people whose relationships you are changing. Now you can undo a change.

## Steps (website)

Here are the steps for removing or replacing a child in a family using Family Tree on the FamilySearch.org website:

1. In the top menu, click **Family Tree**, and then click **Tree**.
2. Find the child with the incorrect parents.

.
7. If only one parent is incorrect, click **Remove or Replace** next to the incorrect parent. If both are incorrect, click **Remove or Replace** next to the child.
8. A Remove or Replace box appears. Verify relationships, sources, and notes, then click the **check box**.
9. Do one of the following:

	1. To remove a parent or parents, click the appropriate **Remove** button. Explain why, and then click **Remove**.
	2. To replace a parent or parents, click the appropriate **Replace** button. The Replace Person screen appears.
	
		* If you know a parent's ID number, click **By ID Number**. Enter the ID number, and then click **Next**. Click **Add Match**.
		
			+ If you want to add both parents, click **Select Couple**.
			+ To add one parent, click **Select Person**. Explain your reason for the change, and then click **Replace**.
		* If you do not know a parent's ID number, complete the search fields, and then click **Next**.
		
			+ If the correct person or couple appears in the list, click **Add Match**. If you want to add both parents, click **Select Couple**, To add one parent, click **Select Person**. Explain your reason for the change, and then click **Replace**.

## Recommended next steps

Removing or changing the parent\-child relationship does not remove or change the parents' couple relationship. If the mother or father is wrong, you must also remove or replace one of the spouses.

# How do I create a source in Family Tree?

## Before you start

* If you use a source that is not on FamilySearch, manually enter the title, web page, citation, and notes.
* As you enter the source, provide enough information for another person to find it.
* You can add sources to both living and deceased individuals in Family Tree. Sources can come from other websites, your personal records, or printed material.

## Tips

* When you create a source for an ancestor, provide enough context for other users to trust. Give information to help others find the record, such as a web address.
* Enter a title that helps you recognize the specific record later.
* Enter any other information that you think is helpful for others.

## Steps (website)

1. Sign in to [FamilySearch](http://www.familysearch.org)
2. Navigate to the Family Tree profile of the person.
3. Display the sources or relationship sources:

	* If the source is about a person, click the **Sources**tab.
	* If the source is about a couple relationship, click the **Details**tab. In the **Family Members** section, click the **pencil icon** next to the couple's marriage information.
	* If the source is about a parent\-child relationship, click the **Details**tab. Scroll to the **Family Members** section, and click the **pencil icon** next to the child's name.
4. Click **Add Source**.
5. Click **Add New Source** or **Add New Memory Source**.
6. Enter the source information, including the reason to attach a source.
7. (Optional) By default, the small box next to "Add Source to My Source Box" is checked. If you want to use the source for other people, leave the check mark. You can then attach the record from the source box to other family members.

# How do I handle unfinished attachments in Family Tree?

In Family Tree, you can see the message, “This source has not been attached to all people found in the record,” on some sources. The source contains information about one or more people, and the source is not attached to them.

## Steps (website)

1. On a person’s Sources tab, click **Unfinished Attachments**.
2. Use the source linker to do one of the following:

	* Attach the record to the other people whose records are already in Family Tree.
	* Add the missing people to Family Tree.
	
		+ **Important:** Before you add a person to Family Tree from the record, be sure to indicate whether the person is living. FamilySearch keeps information about living people private. If the person is marked as living, only you are able to see this record in Family Tree.
	* Nothing. Some records, like obituaries, mention people that are not closely related to the primary person on the record.
3. To dismiss the unfinished attachment notification, click **Dismiss**.

	* **Tip:** If you dismiss the unfinished attachment notification, the notification is removed for all users. You cannot go back and review the dismissed notification. However, you can review the attachments for all sources attached to a person in Family Tree. Simply click the source's title, and then click **Review Attachments**.
4. If you do not want to see the unfinished attachments messages, click **Options** at the top of the Sources tab. Click the **switch** next to **Unfinished Attachments**. The option remains off until you turn it back on again.

## Steps (mobile app)

1. Navigate to a person page in the FamilySearch Family Tree app.
2. Below the dark bar with the name, tap **Sources**.
3. Find a source with the message "This source has not been attached to all people found in the record."
4. Tap **Review Attachments**.
5. Tap a name in the list that does not show a check mark.
6. If you want to attach the source, enter a reason to attach, and tap **Yes, Attach**. Otherwise, tap the back arrow to leave the review screen, and tap **Leave**.
7. To dismiss the notification, tap **Dismiss**

# Tagging sources in Source Linker

When you tag a source, you turn it into a reference for a detail listed on the person page in Family Tree. The option to create a tag appears in the left column of Source Linker after you click the purple Compare button.

## What are the different categories of tags?

Depending on the information contained in the source, you can tag the source to any of the details mentioned on the person page, including:

* Name
* Birth
* Death
* Sex
* Christening
* Burial
* Residence

To tag the source to the detail, click **the checkbox** that appears next to it. You can also remove the source from a particular detail by unchecking the checkbox.

# A new look and feel for Source Linker

Video: //www.youtube.com/embed/Ga\-MJrGIvr4?enablejsapi\=1\&playsinline\=1
We’ve improved our technology to provide a faster, more secure experience. We’ve also updated the design to make room for new features that help you link sources to your ancestors.

For example, we added color to various links and buttons to help users understand their options better.

* The green Add button is for adding a person in the historical record to the FamilySearch Family Tree. If the ancestor is already in Family Tree, the green Add button will be for adding a detail or fact to an ancestor’s person page.
* The purple Compare button is for deciding if the person in the record is the same as the person in Family Tree. If this is the case, you can attach the record to the person’s profile.
* The detach button is for removing the connection between the historical record and the person in Family Tree. You would do this if you discovered that the person in the historical record is different from the person mentioned in Family Tree.

We also created a separate viewing panel on the right side of the screen for viewing records and person profiles from Family Tree.

The panel is an important addition because it allows you to view this information without leaving the Source Linker.

The panel opens when you click on a person’s name or click the button to view the record.

# Understanding the focus person in Source Linker

The focus person is the central figure in Source Linker. All other individuals are displayed in relation to that person.

## How do I know which name is the focus person?

When you open Source Linker, the focus person will appear under a blue bar near the top of the two columns of Source Linker. The name of the focus person also appears at the top of the page on the left as a link.

The link opens a new tab with more detailed information about this person.

## Can I change the focus person?

Yes. Here’s how:

1. Find the current focus person on either column of Source Linker.
2. In the blue bar above the focus person’s name, click **Change Person**.
3. Review the list of options, and select a new focus person.

## Why would I change the focus person?

Changing the focus person gives you the ability to re\-order the relationships so you can see if the source can be attached to more people.

# Understanding the Source Linker screen layout

Source Linker consists of a left column and a right column.

* The left column shows you details from the historical record.
* The right column shows you details from the ancestor’s person page in Family Tree. If the ancestor is not in Family Tree yet, you will see an option for adding the ancestor.

In most cases, you are using Source Linker to add the record to an existing ancestor’s person page. Added records serve as evidence that the ancestor’s details in Family Tree are accurate.

# Unfinished Attachments \- How to add Others on Record to Family Tree

## Table of Contents:

1. [Attaching a person from the record to someone already in Family Tree](#attaching-individuals-from-the-record-to-someone-already-in-family-tree)
2. [Attaching a person from the record to a new profile in Family Tree](#attaching-individuals-from-the-record-to-a-new-profile-in-family-tree)
3. [Remove the Unfinished Attachments notification](#remove-the-unfinished-attachments-notification)

If not all people identified in a record are attached to a profile in Family Tree, the "Unfinished Attachments" notification appears in the Source listing. Some people identified in the record could be unrelated to the focus person. Examples include a neighbor, friend, ecclesiastical leader, informant, or employer. Unrelated people show in the Others on Record section of the record.

## From the Source list on a person page:

1. From the Source list on a person page, click **Unfinished Attachments**. The Source Linker opens.
2. The panel on the left shows people from the record. The panel on the right shows people in Family Tree that match the record.
3. Locate the Others on Record section toward the bottom of the page. Click **Open**.
4. Review the names in the Others on Record section.

	* A name with a check mark beside it indicates that the record is already attached to someone in Family Tree. You do not need to change anything for that person.

## Attach people from the record to someone already in Family Tree:

If names in the Others on Record list match someone listed on the right side of the Source Linker, use these steps:

1. Drag and drop the name so that it lines up with a name on the right side of the Source Linker.
2. Click **Attach**.
3. Review the information about the person.
4. Add a reason for why you are attaching the record and click **Attach**.
5. If you decide the person is not a match, click and drag the name back to Others on Record.

## Attach people from the record to a new profile in Family Tree:

If names do not match names on the right side of the Source linker, you can add the name to Family Tree. Keep in mind that the person could still be alive. Living person profiles are private and are not found in a search.

1. From Source Linker, click **View Record** to open the Record Information panel on the right. Look for what year the record was created. The Record Information can give clues about people and relationships on the record. Look at the original document image if it is available on FamilySearch.org.

	* If the document was created within the last century or so, research the person and decide if they are deceased.
	* If a person is deceased and is related to the focus person, drag and drop the name to the appropriate section of the record.
	
		+ Click **Add** and create a profile in Family Tree. In the panel on the right, enter information for the person.
		+ Click **Create New Person**.
	* To create a Family Tree profile for a person who is not related to the focus person on the record, continue with step 2\.
2. At the top of the page, click **Family Tree**.
3. Right\-click **Recents** and click **Open in a new tab**. Opening in a new tab keeps you from losing your Source Linker page.
4. Click the new tab.
5. Scroll to the bottom of the Recents list and click **Add Unconnected Person**.
6. Add the name of the person that you want to add to Family Tree. Enter information that you found in the record.
7. Click **Next**.
8. Click **Create Person**.
9. From the new person page, click their **Tree ID**.
10. Return to the Source Linker page.
11. In the panel on the left, click **Change Person**. Click the person you just added to Family Tree.
12. In the panel on the right, click **Change Person**.
13. Right\-click in the search bar at the top of the panel. From the drop\-down menu, click **Paste**.
14. The ID of the new person appears in the search bar.
15. Click **Select.**
16. Click **Attach**.
17. Enter a reason to attach the record.
18. Click **Attach**.
19. Continue working through the names listed in the Others on Record section until all are attached.
20. If you do not find enough information to determine that a person is deceased, you can leave them unattached.

## Remove the Unfinished Attachments notification:

From the Source list on a person page, click **Dismiss**.

To turn off the Unfinished Attachments notifications, click the **Options** tab in the upper\-right corner of the Source list. Click the **toggle**.

If you dismiss the unfinished attachment notification, no user sees it. You cannot go back and review the dismissed notification. However, you can review the attachments for all sources attached to a person in Family Tree. Click the source title, and then click **Review Attachments**.

# Using drag and drop in Source Linker to organize families

In most cases, the names that you see listed in the left column of Source Linker represent members of the same family. If the names on the left column are not aligned correctly with the names on the right, you can rearrange them by dragging and dropping them with your mouse. This includes the names of relatives that appear in the “Other” section at the bottom of the left column.

If a name can be moved, the drag\-and\-drop icon will appear when you hover the mouse over that name.

To move a name:

1. Click and hold the mouse button down over a name.
2. Drag the name to the appropriate location in the left column.
3. Release the mouse button to drop the name.

## If there is no matching name

If there are no matching names but you are confident that a name in the left column is a family member, see [Adding people to the Family Tree through Source Linker](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/creating-new-people-in-family-tree)

# Using Source Linker to attach sources

Video: //www.youtube.com/embed/6c4G\_Nz4XFw?enablejsapi\=1\&playsinline\=1
Source Linker uses a purple Compare icon to notify you that the left column (the source) has information that the right column (Family Tree) is missing.

When Source Linker first opens, the information for [the focus person](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/understanding-the-focus-person-in-source-linker) will be expanded in both columns. If you decide that the columns describe the same person, you can move the information from the left column to the right column so that it appears in both columns. This is what we call attaching the source to Family Tree. Let’s take a closer look at how it works.

1. With Source Linker open, click the purple **Compare icon**. If you do not see the Compare icon, the source is already attached, or it does not contain any new information.
2. After you click **Compare**, the two Source Linker columns expand so that you can see the details on the record (left column) and compare them with the details already contained in Family Tree (right column).
3. A new or previously unknown detail will be accompanied by a green plus button.
4. If they describe the same person, you can add the detail to Family Tree by clicking the green **plus button**.
5. Consider entering an explanation in the Reason field. Briefly explain why you think the record is a reliable match for the Tree person. This will help other users trust your contribution.

**What the purple Different tag means**

In some cases, the detail in the record is not necessarily new, but it is just different from what you see in the Family Tree side of Source Linker. For example, a name could be spelled differently, or the date for an important life event could be different.

When this happens, you will not see the green plus button. Instead, the detail will be accompanied by a purple tag with the word Different inside it and a small pencil icon for editing the information in Family Tree.

* The Different tag does *not* always mean a change needs to be made. For example, if a birth year on the record is an estimate, but the birth year in Family Tree came from a birth certificate, you would want to keep the birth year already in Family Tree.
* If you decide that the information in the left column is more accurate or complete, click the pencil icon, and make your edit.
* Your correction makes the Tree more accurate and reliable for other users.

# View records and Tree profiles without leaving Source Linker

Previously, clicking the record or the person link in Source Linker took you to a new page. While the information you found there could be helpful, the overall experience was less than ideal because you had to leave Source Linker to get to it.

 * To improve this experience, we created a new viewing panel that appears to the right of the Source Linker columns.
* The panel opens whenever you click the View Record button or the name of a person in the right column of Source Linker.

# Viewing the image or record from Source Linker

When you have questions about the details you see in Source Linker, try viewing either the record or the source image for more information. If available, the link to either resource will appear directly above the left column of Source Linker.

 ## Viewing the record

The record is a digital transcription of the information contained in the source. It is the source as it was read and interpreted by either a volunteer or a computer.

* The benefit of viewing the record is that the information is clear and easy to read.
* With that said, if there is a mistake in the transcription, you will not be able to identify that mistake by viewing the record alone.

## Viewing the image

The image is a photograph of the actual source. It contains everything that was written, typed, or printed on the source. In most cases, it is a more complete resource than the record.

## Where to look

To view the record or the image, go to the top of the left column of Source Linker, and click **View Record** or **View Image**.

* A viewing panel will open on the right side of the screen where you can explore the resource without losing your place in Source Linker.
* If you do not see a link for viewing the image, it may be that FamilySearch does not currently own the rights to share the digital image.

# Viewing the source image and side panel in Source Linker

When you have questions about the details you see in Source Linker, try viewing either the source image or the person side panel for more information.

## Viewing the source image

The source image is a digital image of the source. In many instances, it contains more information than what you see in Source Linker and might even reveal a mistake in the transcription.

 To view the source image, look in the top left corner of Source Linker, and click **View Image**.

## What is the difference between viewing the record and viewing the image?

When you click **View Record**, you see an organized summary of all of the details that were transcribed from the source.

 When you click **View Image**, you see a digital image of the actual source that was transcribed—in other words, you see the photograph of the birth certificate, census page, death certificate, or other historical document.

## Viewing the person side panel

The person side panel appears whenever you click a name in the right column of Source Linker. This panel gives you access to much of the information contained in the ancestor’s person page in Family Tree.

# What are record hints in Family Tree?

Video: //www.youtube.com/embed/n52oIMZ7U2o?enablejsapi\=1\&playsinline\=1
Record hints are historical records that Family Tree finds for you about your ancestors. Family Tree conducts this search automatically. In fact, since we are always adding new historical records to FamilySearch, our hinting system is always looking for new record hints about your ancestors.

## How do record hints help me?

Record hints can help you learn more about your ancestors. You may learn your ancestor’s occupation or find a physical description. A record hint may identify missing children, parents, siblings, and other relatives. You can transfer information from the record to Family Tree without having to retype it.

## What should I do with record hints?

To get the most from record hints, you do three basic tasks:

* Make sure that the record hint really is about your ancestor.
* Transfer any information that you want from the record hint to Family Tree. (On the website, you cannot currently replace information that is already in Family Tree with better information from the record. Instead, you will need to go into Family Tree and make those updates manually. You can replace information already in FamilyTree when attaching using the mobile Family Tree app.)
* Attach the record hint to your ancestors in Family Tree. This saves the record as a source to your ancestors' records in Family Tree.

# What are the benefits of adding sources to Family Tree?

A source is historical material. Examples include a picture, journal, Bible, document, or other item that contains evidence about your family history. Sources are critical to the genealogical process for documentation and discovery. In Family Tree, you can attach sources to people, couple relationships, parent\-child relationships, and other relationships.

Sources provide many benefits:

* They make it easier for users to work together in Family Tree. Sources can settle or prevent disputes.
* They add richness to the tree. Information about your ancestors on a record can increase your awareness that your ancestors were real people and that you really are connected to them.
* They demonstrate the accuracy of the information in the tree.
* They help you evaluate conflicting information. When you find conflicting information, such as 2 different birth dates for the same person, sources can help determine which one is most likely to contain the correct information.
* They acknowledge work done by others.

# How does Family Tree protect the privacy of living people?

To protect privacy, Family Tree limits who can see the records of living people. Only the user who entered the information about a living person into Family Tree can see or change the record.

Be cautious as you attach memories to living people. In some circumstances, others can see the memory items. We recommend that you set the memories about living people to private.

## How do I know if a person that I can see in Family Tree is living?

At the top of a Family Tree profile, beneath the tabs, you see a "Living Person" banner. In addition, the word "Living" appears instead of a death date or the word "Deceased."

## How do I add a living person to Family Tree?

* Add a person to Family Tree and click to select **Living** as you enter vital information.
* Transfer a record of a living person from a database that you manage in a third\-party program.

Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter\-day Saints can sometimes see living people from their Church membership record.

## How do records of living people become public?

A person's record becomes public after you add a death date for the person. The Family Tree does not try to determine whether a person could be deceased. The system does not change the status to deceased based on birth year.

## Can multiple contributors enter the same living person into Family Tree?

Multiple users can enter a profile for the same living person into Family Tree. Each record has a different ID. If you change the profile of a living person, your change does not affect other profiles for the person.
