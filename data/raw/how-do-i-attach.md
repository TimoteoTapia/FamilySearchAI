# In the source linker, how do I change the focus person to attach sources to other people in Family Tree?

In the source linker, the people are listed according to their relationship to a focus person. The focus person is listed with his or her spouse. You see a section with parents and another with children and siblings.

Some historical records identify in\-laws, grandparents, grandchildren, and other family members who are not displayed on the right side of the screen. To deal with these family members, you change the focus person.

For example, a marriage record lists the bride and groom and each of their parents. When you first display the source linker, the bride is the focus person. When you are ready to work on the husband’s information, make him the focus person.  


## Steps (website)


1. While using the source linker on the FamilySearch.org website, click the **Change** link on the left side of the screen.
2. Click the person that you want.
3. In the center of the source linker, click **Change**.
4. Click the person that you want, or enter the ID.

## Steps (mobile app)


The source linker in the mobile app does not allow you to change the focus person.   
**Caution:** Sometimes a record hint lines up with the wrong person. For example, a census could show a child who has the same name as a deceased sibling. Since you cannot change the focus person, tap **Not a match** for that person.
