Search your source box and find the sources you want to use. Searching is helpful if your source box contains many items.

**Tip:** Search your source box and then use filters to narrow your searches even further.  


## Steps (website)


1. While signed into [FamilySearch](http://www.familysearch.org), clickÂ your name.
2. Click **Source Box**.
3. In the search field, enter the words you want to find.

The source box shows the sources whose title contains the text you entered.  


## Steps (mobile app)

## Steps (Family Tree Lite)
