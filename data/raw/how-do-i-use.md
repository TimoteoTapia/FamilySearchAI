# How do I organize my source box with folders?



Article Id: 1686

August 26, 2024

















Use folders to organize the sources in your source box. You can create up to 200 of them. Each one needs a unique name. Here are some ideas:  


* The type of record the folder contains
* The name of the ancestor
* The name of the family line
* The name of a place

Currently, the source box feature is only available on FamilySearch.org.   


## Steps


1. While signed into [FamilySearch](http://www.familysearch.org), click your name.
2. Click **Source Box**.
3. Click **New Folder**.
4. Enter a name in the pop\-up box in the **Add Folder** screen.
5. Click **Add.**
6. Click the box next to each source you want to move or click the **Select All** box.
7. Click **Move** and tap the folder that you want.
