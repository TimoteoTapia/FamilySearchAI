You can add individuals who are not connected to your family line.   
   
You could add an unconnected person who has a probable family relationship that you cannot verify. For example, you could add people who have the same last names and who resided in the same small geographical areas as known ancestors.

Tip: When you add an unconnected person, record the ID of the new record. With the ID, you can quickly find the person again.  
Tip: To find your contributions on the website, click **My Contributions**, then **My Changes**. To find unconnected living people that you added, click **Private People**.
