# View records and Tree profiles without leaving Source Linker



Article Id: 24143

Previously, clicking the record or the person link in Source Linker took you to a new page. While the information you found there could be helpful, the overall experience was less than ideal because you had to leave Source Linker to get to it.   


 * To improve this experience, we created a new viewing panel that appears to the right of the Source Linker columns.
* The panel opens whenever you click the View Record button or the name of a person in the right column of Source Linker.
