# How do I correct parent\-child relationships in Family Tree?

Video: //www.youtube.com/embed/b7K8yBJCMq0?enablejsapi\=1\&playsinline\=1
Correcting parent\-child relationships usually requires some analysis before you begin. Two kinds of problems can exist: duplicate records or incorrect relationship links.

If you make a mistake during this process, do not worry. You can [undo any changes you made](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/how-do-i-undo-an-incorrect-change-in-family-tree) by going through the Latest Changes feature.

When you remove a child's record from a family's records, the child's record stays in Family Tree. If the child is linked to spouses and children, he or she remains linked to them. Similarly, when you remove parents from a relationship to a child, the Family Tree record for each parent remains in Family Tree.

## Before you start

Take some time to figure out what is wrong:

* If the child does not belong in the family, remove or replace the child's link to the parents.
* If the children are right but one or both parents are wrong, you must remove or replace the incorrect parent. Remove or replace [the spouse](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/a-person-in-family-tree-has-the-wrong-spouse) of the correct parent.
* If you see the parents and children multiple times, or in multiple families, look at the ID numbers of the duplicates.

	+ If the ID numbers are different, [merge the duplicate records](https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/how-do-i-merge-possible-duplicates-in-family-tree).
	+ If the ID numbers are identical, the child is linked to one of the parents more than once. Use the instructions in this article to remove the extra relationship.

**Tip:** Write down the names and ID numbers of the people whose relationships you are changing. Now you can undo a change.

Removing or changing the parent\-child relationship does not remove or change the parents' couple relationship. If the mother or father is wrong, you must also remove or replace one of the spouses.
