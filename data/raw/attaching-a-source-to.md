# Using Source Linker to attach a record to multiple ancestors



Historical records often include the names of other family members. You can use Source Linker to attach the source to any family member already included in Family Tree. If the person is not yet in Family Tree, you can add the person, and then attach the source after that.

Here is how it works:

1. Review the left column of Source Linker, and look for the names of other family members.
2. When you find the name of another family member, see if there is a corresponding name in the right column. (Hint: if the corresponding names are on different lines, you can drag and drop them with your mouse so that they line up together.)
3. Click the purple **Compare button**.
4. Review the information, and determine if the 2 sides of Source Linker are describing the same person.
5. If the answer is yes, leave a reason statement that explains how you came to your conclusion, and click **Attach**.

**Note:** If something in the source is new or missing from Family Tree, you will have to first click **Add** to add the detail to the right column and then click **Attach**.
