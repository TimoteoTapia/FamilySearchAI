# How do I create a source in Family Tree?

## Before you start

* If you use a source that is not on FamilySearch, manually enter the title, web page, citation, and notes.
* As you enter the source, provide enough information for another person to find it.
* You can add sources to both living and deceased individuals in Family Tree. Sources can come from other websites, your personal records, or printed material.

## Tips

* When you create a source for an ancestor, provide enough context for other users to trust. Give information to help others find the record, such as a web address.
* Enter a title that helps you recognize the specific record later.
* Enter any other information that you think is helpful for others.

## Steps (website)

1. Sign in to [FamilySearch](http://www.familysearch.org)
2. Navigate to the Family Tree profile of the person.
3. Display the sources or relationship sources:

	* If the source is about a person, click the **Sources**tab.
	* If the source is about a couple relationship, click the **Details**tab. In the **Family Members** section, click the **pencil icon** next to the couple's marriage information.
	* If the source is about a parent\-child relationship, click the **Details**tab. Scroll to the **Family Members** section, and click the **pencil icon** next to the child's name.
4. Click **Add Source**.
5. Click **Add New Source** or **Add New Memory Source**.
6. Enter the source information, including the reason to attach a source.
7. (Optional) By default, the small box next to "Add Source to My Source Box" is checked. If you want to use the source for other people, leave the check mark. You can then attach the record from the source box to other family members.
8. Click **Save**.

## Steps (mobile app)

In the Family Tree mobile app, you cannot add sources to couple relationships or parent\-child relationships. You can add a source to a person.

1. Navigate to the person.
2. Tap the **Sources**tab.
3. Tap **\+**.
4. Tap one of the options:

	* To search the records database for a source to attach, tap **Search Records**.
	* If the source is online, tap **Add a Source with a Web Page**.
	* If you want to use a digital image, tap **Add a Source with a Photo**.
5. If you tapped to add a source with a photo, tap **Add Photo**. You can take a photo with your device. You can choose a photo from your device or files. You can go to your FamilySearch Gallery to choose the image.
6. Enter the source information. Include a reason for attaching the source.
7. Tap **Save**.

## Steps (Family Tree Lite)

Sources cannot be added through Family Tree Lite. Please visit the full website instead.
